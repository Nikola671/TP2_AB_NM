# TP2_AB_NM
This is the GitHub repository for the DS-160-01 team project #2. Attached is the csv with the data as well as 
the jupyter notebook with the completed EDA, multiple linear regression model prediction total revenue of a movie ('Collection'), and logistic model predicting if a movie will win an Oscar ('Start_Tech_Oscar'). 
Each of the two models has 5 rows of data reserved from the training set to validate the predicted values from the model. We visualized the actual and predicted values with a table and a graph for each model.
